+ Project summary: In this project, we perform different collaborative filtering algorithms on two datasets: MS dataset and movie dataset. The algorithms include memory-based algorithms (specifying similarity weight, variance weighting and method of selecting neighbours) and model-based algorithms (cluster models). We evaluate and compare a pair of algorithms for collaborative filtering based on MAE and rank score.

**Contribution statement**: Jingtian Yao and Keran Li prepocessed the raw data and implemented the sim rank algorithm.Wenyuan Gu was responcible for the cluster model and weighted variance.
